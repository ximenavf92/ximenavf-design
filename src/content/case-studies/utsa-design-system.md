problem: "When I joined the UTSA marketing team, one of the glaring issues was the university's disjointed web presence. Despite sharing colors, the website looked like a mishmash of different schools and departments, lacking cohesion and a unified identity. My primary mission was to address this by spearheading the creation and development of a comprehensive design system that would unify UTSA's online presence while allowing for creativity and flexibility across departments."
aboutOrg: "UTSA, a Hispanic-thriving university, prioritizes student success and research excellence. As one of around 20 Hispanic-serving institutions with Tier One research status, UTSA stands as a model for urban-serving public universities. Dedicated to transformative learning, UTSA contributes to San Antonio's growth as the nation's seventh-largest city, considering the city an extended campus that embodies its commitment to community and education."
solution: "My role involved pitching the need for a unified design system to leadership and stakeholders, planning, and conducting an exhaustive audit of our existing websites. This audit helped us identify key elements to tackle initially, such as navigation, footers, color palettes, and typefaces. By expanding an existing pattern library created for the academics department, we aimed to encompass a broader range of needs, thus laying the groundwork for a more cohesive website that served marketing and promotional purposes across various departments."
